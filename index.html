	<h1>Josh Baker</h1>
	<p>I am an engineer currently working as a Data Scientist with interests in human computer interaction, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.  Some of my personal projects are listed below:</p>

	<h2>VR</h2>
	<ul>
	   <li><p><a href= 'http://joshfbaker.github.io/Three.js-Cardboard-Boilerplates/'>Three.js + Google Cardboard Boilerplates</a>  The Three.js library combined with the Google Cardboard enables perhaps the most lightweight VR experience there is.  As Three.js scenes can be rendered in mobile web browsers, these demos should work on all smartphones - no need to purchase expensive hardware or install any software.  I hope these boilerplates reduce the barrier to entry for VR developers and vastly increase the size of the potential audience for VR experiences</p></li>
