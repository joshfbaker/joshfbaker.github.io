    "text": "Intro\nRecently it seems like there have been a truly dizzying number of LLM models released. I normally come across these announcements on X or Hacker News and I find it increasingly difficult to keep track of who released which model when. And I find it even harder to fit each new release into the larger context.\n\nWhat version of Llama are we on?\nDid Qwen 2 come out before or after Phi-3?\nWhen might we be due for the next release from Antropic?\n\n\n\nThe Dataset\nI searched for a dataset with organization, model series, model, model release date, and number of parameters but had trouble finding something comprehensive. So I set about curating my own.\nI focused on ‚Äúopen‚Äù model series, defined here as those that supported commercial use in most cases. I also threw in some of the main closed models for additional context. I wanted to avoid recording all models to keep the visualization interpretable, so I focused on ‚Äúhigh profile‚Äù models.\nWikipedia‚Äôs LLM was a great starting point. Ollama Library and Hugging Face(https://huggingface.co/) models cards helped to fill in some gaps along with Google to get to individual model release pages.\n\n\nTimeline\nI quite like timeline visualizations for making sense of the world.\nI‚Äôm a big fan of the plotly.express.timeline implementation in particular. px.timeline yields an interactive, web-based visualization with filtering, zooming, and hover capabilities. It has sensible defaults for a quick first draft, but is also highly configurable to enable fine-tuning of the visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of Recent LLM Releases: Models by Organization colored by model series. Notches with cross hatches indicate that commericial use is not. Hover for additional metadat including exact release date and model sizes.\n\n\n\nNext steps\nAfter investing the time to build the initial dataset and visualization, it should be easy to keep up to date, which I‚Äôll likely do every several months.\nI think there are also some interesting extensions to this work:\n\nPrompt an LLM to generate the dataset. Knowledge cut-offs mean I‚Äôd have to code the LLM to use web browsing tools (now possible with Ollama) to query for the very latest announcements.\nI‚Äôm also interested in generating other visualizations that I haven‚Äôt seen yet, for example:\n\na scatter plot visualization of model performance versus quantized models size to aid in model selection. Is full size 16-bit Llama3 8B better or worse than 4-bit Llama3 70B?\n\ntree diagrams to illustrate the lineage of models through pre-training, fine-tuning, HLRF, quantization, and any other steps.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nI‚Äôd love to hear any feedback on the effectiveness of this timeline visualization or if you think I‚Äôm missing any major models!"

    "text": "Wise\nLiving in Europe, you quickly discover you need a European checking account so you can have an IBAN number. Landlords, telecoms, gyms, and anyone else that‚Äôs expecting a recurring payment will require you to provide an IBAN number.\nWe went with Wise based on recommendations from colleagues and our own research. Wise is a FinTech company that makes it super simple to open accounts for many types of currencies (although we stick with Euros). Wise also lets you transfer USD to Euros at a very fair (mid-market) exchange rate and only moderate fees (about 0.7% per $1,000 moved).\nThe only drawback we‚Äôve experienced is the stingy cash withdral limits. Wise caps you at two free withdawals per month up to a total of 100 Euros. After that you have to pay 1.50 per withdrawal plus 2% fee which it quite hefty. As many establishments only take cash, we anticipated quickly blowing through out 100 Euro allowance per month, so we decided to look for another solution for pulling out cash."

    "text": "Chase Sapphire Preferred\nMinimizing fees via debit payments is great, but in talking with friends it seems like we were missing out on points/cash back via credit cards. After shopping around, we settled on the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card for several reasons:\n\nit has zero foreign transaction fees\n3x points on dining, 2x points on travel, and 1x on everything else.\n\nVersus Wise (which has an effective -0.7% points due to the fees) using Chase gives a minimum net of +1.7%.\n\n60,000 point sign up bonus\nrelatively low $95 annual fee (and zero fee for adding an authorized user)\n\nWe did look at the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card but just couldn‚Äôt get the benefits to outweigh the $550 annual fee.\nAnother benefit of paying all but the required expenses with a U.S. based card is that you reduce the chance of having to complete FBAR reporting, which gets triggered when the sum of all of your foreign accounts is greater than $10,000.\nFinally, having a card with zero foreign transaction fees let me close out a couple of my non-Euro Wise currency accounts (Swiss Francs, British Pounds, etc.). It‚Äôs now simpler (and more cost effective) to just use the Chase credit card."
