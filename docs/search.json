    "text": "Intro\nThis blog was developed using the Quarto open source publishing system. It is hosted using the serverless, static web page hosting platform GitHub Pages.\n\n\nPre-requisites\n\nVSCode\nPython\n\n\n\nSteps\n\nFollow these instructions to install the Quarto tool and Quarto VSCode Extension.\nInstantiate a Quarto Blog Project\n\nBe sure to set the output-dir to docs in _quarto.yml\nRender the site\n\nPush the project to a new GitHub repo.\nPublish the blog to GitHub Pages\n\n\n\nFurther Thoughts\nIt‚Äôs that easy!\nI really like GitHub Pages as allows for publishing of any static site without needing to worry about provisioning servers, building an authentication system, or providing a credit card number!\nQuarto obviously allows you to create blogs, but you can also generate whole websites, books, and even PowerPoints.

    "text": "Wise\nLiving in Europe, you quickly discover you need a European checking account so you can have an IBAN number. Landlords, telecoms, gyms, and anyone else that‚Äôs expecting a recurring payment will require you to provide an IBAN number.\nWe went with Wise based on recommendations from colleagues and our own research. Wise is a FinTech company that makes it super simple to open accounts for many types of currencies (although we stick with Euros). Wise also lets you transfer USD to Euros at a very fair (mid-market) exchange rate and only moderate fees (about 0.7% per $1,000 moved).\nThe only drawback we‚Äôve experienced is the stingy cash withdral limits. Wise caps you at two free withdawals per month up to a total of 100 Euros. After that you have to pay 1.50 per withdrawal plus 2% fee which it quite hefty. As many establishments only take cash, we anticipated quickly blowing through out 100 Euro allowance per month, so we decided to look for another solution for pulling out cash."

    "text": "Chase Sapphire Preferred\nMinimizing fees via debit payments is great, but in talking with friends it seems like we were missing out on points/cash back via credit cards. After shopping around, we settled on the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card for several reasons:\n\nit has zero foreign transaction fees\n3x points on dining, 2x points on travel, and 1x on everything else.\n\nVersus Wise (which has an effective -0.7% points due to the fees) using Chase gives a minimum net of +1.7%.\n\n60,000 point sign up bonus\nrelatively low $95 annual fee (and zero fee for adding an authorized user)\n\nWe did look at the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card but just couldn‚Äôt get the benefits to outweigh the $550 annual fee.\nAnother benefit of paying all but the required expenses with a U.S. based card is that you reduce the chance of having to complete FBAR reporting, which gets triggered when the sum of all of your foreign accounts is greater than $10,000.\nFinally, having a card with zero foreign transaction fees let me close out a couple of my non-Euro Wise currency accounts (Swiss Francs, British Pounds, etc.). It‚Äôs now simpler (and more cost effective) to just use the Chase credit card."
