# Intro

Recently it seems like there have been a truly dizzying number of LLM models released.  I normally come across these announcements on X or [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and I find it increasingly difficult to keep track of who released which model when.  And I find it even harder to fit each new release into the larger context.

* What version of Llama are we on?
* Did Qwen 2 come out before or after Phi-3?
* When might we be due for the next release from Antropic?  

# The Dataset

I searched for a dataset with organization, model series, model, model release date, and number of parameters but had trouble finding something comprehensive. So I set about curating my own.  

I focused on "open" model series, defined here as those that supported commercial use in most cases.  I also threw in some of the main closed models for additional context.  I wanted to avoid recording all models to keep the visualization interpretable, so I focused on "high profile" models.  

Wikipedia's [LLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model#List) was a great starting point.  [Ollama Library](https://ollama.com/library) and Hugging Face(https://huggingface.co/) models cards helped to fill in some gaps along with Google to get to individual model release pages.

# Timeline

I quite like timeline visualizations for making sense of the world.    

I'm a big fan of the [plotly.express.timeline](https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/generated/plotly.express.timeline.html) implementation in particular.  `px.timeline` yields an interactive, web-based visualization with filtering, zooming, and hover capabilities.  It has sensible defaults for a quick first draft, but is also highly configurable to enable fine-tuning of the visualization.

# Next steps

After investing the time to build the initial dataset and visualization, it should be easy to keep up to date, which I'll likely do every several months.

I think there are also some interesting extensions to this work:

* Prompt an LLM to generate the dataset.  Knowledge cut-offs mean I'd have to code the LLM to use web browsing tools (now possible with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/blog/tool-support)) to query for the very latest announcements.
* I'm also interested in generating other visualizations that I haven't seen yet, for example:
    * a scatter plot visualization of model performance versus quantized models size to aid in model selection.  Is full size 16-bit Llama3 8B better or worse than 4-bit Llama3 70B?   
    * tree diagrams to illustrate the lineage of models through pre-training, fine-tuning, HLRF, quantization, and any other steps.

# Conclusion

I'd love to hear any feedback on the effectiveness of this timeline visualization or if you think I'm missing any major models!
