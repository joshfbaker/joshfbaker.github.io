# Intro

Recently it seems like there have been a truly dizzying number of LLM models released.  I normally come across these announcements on X or [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and I find it increasingly difficult to keep track of who released which model when.  And I find it even harder to fit each new release into the larger context.

* What version of Llama are we on?
* Did Qwen 2 come out before or after Phi-3?
* When might we be due for the next release from Antropic?  

# The Dataset

I searched for the type of dataset I had in mind, but was unable to find one so I set about curating my own.  

I knew I wanted to mostly focus on "open" model series, defined here as those that supported commercial use in most cases.  I also wanted to throw in some of the main closed models for additional context.  I wanted to avoid the trap of trying to record all models to keep the visualization interpretable, so I focused on "high profile" models.

Wikipedia's [LLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model#List) was a great starting point.  [Ollama Library](https://ollama.com/library) and Hugging Face(https://huggingface.co/) models cards helped to fill in some gaps along with Google to get to individual model release pages.

# Timeline

I quite like timeline visualizations for making sense of the world.    

I'm a big fan of [plotly.express.timeline](https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/generated/plotly.express.timeline.html).  `px.timeline` yields an interactive visualization with filtering, zooming, and hover capabilities.  It has sensible defaults so you can quickly visualize your data, but is also highly configurable to enable fine-tuning of the visualization.

# Evaluation


# Next steps
* Now that I've built this, should be easy to keep up to date
* Use LLMs to build this.  Not directly due to knowledge cut off but with tool answering/search
* Other visualizations
    * Visualize things like performance versus quantized size to see tradeoffs with combined size and quantization.  7B raw better than 70B 4bit quantized? 
    * Model Family trees

# Conclusion

Feedback?  Better implementation? Let me know!? Additional models?   Incorrect date?
