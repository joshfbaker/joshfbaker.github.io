# Intro 

This blog was developed using the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) open source publishing system.  It is hosted using the serverless, static web page hosting platform [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

# Pre-requisites
* VSCode
* Python

# Steps
1. Follow [these instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) to install the Quarto tool and Quarto VSCode Extension.
2. [Instantiate a Quarto Blog Project](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html)
    1. Be sure to set the `output-dir` to `docs` in `_quarto.yml`
    1. Render the site
3. Push the project to a new GitHub repo.
3. [Publish the blog to GitHub Pages](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html) 

# Further Thoughts
It's that easy!

I really like GitHub Pages as allows for publishing of any static site without needing to worry about provisioning servers, building an authentication system, or providing a credit card number!

Quarto obviously allows us to create blogs, but we can also generate whole websites, books, and even PowerPoints.  Check out the [Gallery](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/) for more inspiration!
